It's attempt to decouple Identity from Clinical Evidence. 
The patient maintains a master index (The Profile Root) that points to decentralized "Tracks" (Episode records) stored across the web, ensuring the patient remains the ultimate gatekeeper of their health history.
Core Pillars
* **Discovery Manifest**: Medical history items act as discovery flags that resolve to detailed data within external tracks.
* **Multi-Ref Redundancy**: Single medical events can point to multiple storage nodes or schema versions for high availability and verification.
* **Tool Provenance**: Mandatory URI-based tracking of the specific hardware or software source for every data point.
